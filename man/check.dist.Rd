\title{Check or fix a symmetric distance matrix.}
\usage{
check.dist(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{a distance matrix}
}
\value{
a symmetric matrix of the same size as \code{m}, with 0s in the diagonal
}
\description{
If \code{m} is a matrix, check whether it is a valid specification of a
distance matrix and return it, making it symmetric if it isn't already.
For all other obect types, try to coerce \code{m} to a \code{dist} object
and return the corresponding distance matrix.
