  abstract = {Trends in environmental variables are often investigated within a study region at more than one site. At each site, a trend analysis determines whether a trend has occurred. Yet often also of interest is whether a consistent trend is evident throughout the entire region. This paper adapts the Seasonal Kendall trend test to determine whether a consistent regional trend occurs in environmental variables.},

@article{Hirsch1982,
  abstract = {Some of the characteristics that complicate the analysis of water quality time series are non-normal distributions, seasonality, flow relatedness, missing values, values below the limit of detection, and serial correlation. Presented here are techniques that are suitable in the face of the complications listed above for the exploratory analysis of monthly water quality data for monotonie trends. The first procedure described is a nonparametric test for trend applicable to data sets with seasonality, missing values, or values reported as less than: the seasonal Kendall test. Under realistic stochastic processes (exhibiting seasonality, skewness, and serial correlation), it is robust in comparison to parametric alternatives, although neither the seasonal Kendall test nor the alternatives can be considered an exact test in the presence of serial correlation. The second procedure, the seasonal Kendall slope estimator, is an estimator of trend magnitude. It is an unbiased estimator of the slope of a linear trend and has considerably higher precision than a regression estimator where data are highly skewed but somewhat lower precision where the data are normal. The third procedure provides a means for testing for change over time in the relationship between constituent concentration and flow, thus avoiding the problem of identifying trends in water quality that are artifacts of the particular sequence of discharges observed (e.g., drought effects). In this method a flow-adjusted concentration is defined as the residual (actual minus conditional expectation) based on a regression of concentration on some function of discharge. These flow-adjusted concentrations, which may also be seasonal and non-normal, can then be tested for trend by using the seasonal Kendall test.},

@article{Hirsch1984,
  abstract = {Statistical tests for monotonic trend in seasonal (e.g., monthly) hydrologic time series are commonly confounded by some of the following problems : nonnormal data, missing values, seasonality, censoring (detection limits), and serial dependence. An extension of the Mann-Kendall test for trend (designed for such data) is presented here. Because the test is based entirely on ranks, it is robust against nonnormality and censoring. Seasonality and missing values present no theoretical or computational obstacles to its application. Monte Carlo experiments show that, in terms of type I error, it is robust against serial correlation except when the data have strong long-term persistence (e.g., ARMA (1, 1) monthly processes with $\phi$ {\textgreater} 0.6) or short records 5 years). When there is no serial correlation, it is less powerful than a related simpler test which is not robust against serial correlation.},

  abstract = {In many experiments the background evidence, theories, or conditions suggest an expected ordering among the treatment effects, yet in the analysis of variance such implicit hypotheses are typically neglected. A ranking statistic L is presented as test of a monotonic relationship among the treatment groups in the two-way analysis of variance. Used with accompanying table of L, it combines considerable power with computational ease, and assumes data of only ordinal strength. L is related to the test of the linear component of the treatment sum of squares in the parametric randomized-block design, to the product- moment correlation and regression, to the normal deviate test of Lyerly's average rho, and to Friedman's chi-square of ranks. Where either L or the Friedman test may be used, L is often more accurate and appro- priate, and it has some advantages over other tests of trend and mono- tonicity},

This tutorial introduces readers to mixed models, Growth Curve Analysis (GCA) and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). These approaches are ideal for analyzing nonlinear change over time where there are nested dependencies, such as time points within dyad (in repeated interaction experiments) or time points within chain (in iterated learning experiments). In addition, the tutorial gives recommendations for choices about model fitting. Annotated scripts in the online Supplementary Data provide the reader with R code to serve as a springboard for the reader's own analyses.},
