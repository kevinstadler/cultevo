# Cultural evolution in R

[![CRAN version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/cultevo)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cultevo) ![CRAN downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/cultevo) [![Code Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/kevinstadler/cultevo/branch/master/graphs/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/kevinstadler/cultevo/)

The **cultevo** R package provides tools, measures and statistical tests often used in the study of cultural evolution, in particular for measuring the compositionality of signalling systems as well as computing string and meaning distance matrices. It also provides an accurate implementation of Page's test for monotonicity of ranks.
