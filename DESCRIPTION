Description: This package provides implementations of functions and statistical
    tests often used in the study of cultural evolution. It provides functions
    for measuring the compositionality of signaling systems, computing string
    and meaning distance matrices, as well as a robust implementation of Page's
    test for monotonicity of ranks.
